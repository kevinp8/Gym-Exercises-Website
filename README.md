# Golds Gym
This app allows you to search up exercises you could do based on target muscle, or equipment available. Each exercise has a gif and list of videos on how to perform the exercise. Similar exercises are suggested on each page.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, RapidAPI, MaterialUI

The gifs and videos are fetched from the Golds Gym API from RapidAPI and then rendered using MaterialUI components for React. React router is used to give each video its own page which also has suggested videos.

## Future updates
- Account signup/login
- Routines: create playlists of different exercises depending on what kind of workout you want to do

## Lessons Learned:

This project was helpful in keeping my React skills polished, but I also found how much easier development can be using npm packages. Usually styling is a hassle with css but using MaterialUI made it quick and enjoyable.
